                        <p>
        Thanks for stopping by; I appreciate my friends' willingness to share this website with you! You’ll find three chapters of a book; they were written with God’s direction and ideas. 

        It's a book that is kind of hard to describe so I won’t offer a description. I would love for you to read the testimonials and the three chapters. I’m seeking, through your input, guidance on whether to make the chapters and the rest of the book more widely available. Please click on the "Want to read more?” button and let me know what you think. My hope is that if it's God's plan, these chapters and the book may help others build a meaningful relationship with God!

        Thank you, in advance, for your time and reactions! 
                        </p>

                            <div class="testimonial--body">"In a world where much of what we read day to day is not at all uplifting, this book has changed that paradigm. The author has weaved and brought together everyday life through one unique and lovely activity - reading the Bible! Placed along the way there are surprises - fun, delightful, helpful - ones!

                            <div class="testimonial--body">"The writing style in these pages is very unique; it's a style and category all in itself that I've not read anything like before. It's a read that instantly draws you in and is so easy to relate to that it's comfortable and enjoyable, yet the underlying theme the author gives is woven nicely throughout…that theme being one of encouragement to all people to make a conscious decision to set time aside daily for reading and studying the Bible. The author's approach in this read gives wonderful examples of just how to accomplish that and you'll see that it's not complicated or out of reach. Just start reading…"</div>
